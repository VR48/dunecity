# Browser build

DuneCity can be compiled to WebAssembly with Emscripten and published as a
static browser application. The browser package includes the base game data,
configuration, JavaScript loader, and WebAssembly executable.

## Build

Install the pinned Emscripten SDK on the D: drive:

```powershell
.\scripts\install-emsdk.ps1
```

Build and copy the browser package into the website repository:

```powershell
.\scripts\package-web.ps1
```

The defaults use these paths:

- SDK: `D:\BotServer\Tools\emsdk`
- Build: `D:\BotServer\Builds\Dune2R-web`
- Website output: `D:\BotServer\GitHub\dunelegacy.com\website\play`

Serve the website directory over HTTP for local testing. Opening the generated
HTML directly from disk will not load the WebAssembly data package.

```powershell
python -m http.server 8098 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory D:\BotServer\GitHub\dunelegacy.com\website
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8098/play/`.

## Runtime

- The 640x480 game canvas scales to fit the browser while retaining its 4:3
  aspect ratio.
- Configuration and saves live under `/home/web_user` in the virtual file
  system and are synchronized to browser IndexedDB.
- The bootstrap JavaScript and CSS are external files so the deployed page can
  enforce a strict Content Security Policy without `unsafe-inline`.
- `build.json` records SHA-256 hashes for the complete browser artifact set.
- Menus and gameplay yield through Asyncify so the browser remains responsive.
- The original first-launch intro is skipped in the browser. It can still be
  enabled from the game options.
- Native builds keep their existing paths, delays, crash handlers, networking,
  and first-launch behavior.

## Networking boundary

The browser build is currently a single-player release. Browsers cannot open
the native UDP sockets used by ENet, and browser WebSockets cannot connect
directly to a native ENet server. Browser multiplayer requires a secure
WebSocket gateway that translates between WebSocket clients and the game's
native ENet protocol. Do not advertise browser multiplayer until that gateway
and protocol compatibility tests are deployed.
